 Provide another enumerated to-do list with the set of features and performance tests that you plan to include in the next phase of your work.

In the next month, we have several tasks to complete.

0)	We will debug why the threaded performance of the naive algorithm seems to be worse than the single-core performance
	-Fix thread spawn overhead by rearranging internal loops.
	-Make sure that the intersect counter lock/lockfree update data structure

1)	We will create a graphical visualization subroutine that will allow us to inspect the progression of the simulation in 3D (albeit slower).
	-This will allow us to debug why there are currently many extra intersections

2)	We will create a set of benchmark parameters through trial and error that represents the parameters of our final dataset (seed value, number of balls, number of timestamp)
3)	We will attempt to implement the predictive algorithm using a data structure with a single global queue
4)	We will run our benchmarks for the naive algorithm and the two predictive algorithms, on the following configurations
	-1 core, multithreaded and single threaded
	-8 core, multithreaded and single threaded
	-48 core, multithreaded and single threaded
