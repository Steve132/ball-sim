%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

\begin{abstract} %Steven
The general simulation of n-body systems often requires the simulation of pairwise interaction between the objects.  
The naive method of simulation is $O(n^2)$ operations per timestep in the number of objects.  However, this method scales very well to multiple cores.
In this paper, we propose a novel method of pairwise simulation that saves a significant amount of computation time by predicting possible future outcomes rather
than reacting to them.  We demonstrate the implementation of this method, as well as prove that it has amortized $O(n)$ complexity per timestep.  We also demonstrate
a lock-free method to allow this algorithm to scale to multiple cores of a shared memory machine.

\section{Project Progress}
This project is progressing well.  Save several hiccups in the implementation, we now have a very large and stable mature codebase that implements the naive implementations of the algorithm and allows
us to visualize the result.
\subsection{Challenges Encountered}
We encountered several challenges when implementing this project.  Although the simulation algorithm is simple in theory, debugging and implementing the physics behind the spheres caused a few small problems we did not forsee.

\subsubsection{Visualizer}
We had a great deal of small bugs that needed to be solved.  The primary method of solving this problem from a debugging perspective was the implementation of a real-time visualization in OpenGL.
This visualization was a little slow, but it facilitated debugging of our simulation.  Creating this visualization required some tweaking of the core simulator to allow a callback hook, as well as some OpenGL code to render the spheres in real-time.

\subsubsection{Sticky Spheres}
At our first running of the algorithm, we noticed that the number of registered sphere-sphere collisions was greater than the number of timesteps.  This should be impossible, as a sphere-sphere collision should
occur very rarely, depending on the total volume of the space and the number of spheres in the simulation.  Even when the number of spheres was 2, this phenomena occured.  Upon debugging the simulation with the visualizer,
we observed that any time a sphere collided with a larger sphere, it immediately became stuck inside the larger one, as shown in the figure.  

%TODO: figure

This problem generated 1 sphere-sphere collisions for each frame, for each pair of 'stuck' spheres.  To mitigate this problem, we implemented a simple hack that pushed the spheres away from each other by a distance equal to the sum of their radii plus an epsilon.
This dramatically reduced the number of sphere-sphere collisions to the correct number.

\subsubsection{Thread Overhead}
	Our implementation of the threading uses the OpenMP compiler extension subsystem.  Our implementation, which is a part of gcc 4.5, is built on top of pthreads under linux.  In our implementation, we 
spawn a number of worker threads per timestamp in order to thread the system.  Our implementation of the naive algorithm should scale linearly with the number of threads.  However, in our implementation this is not the case.  We strongly suspect that
several factors could be contributing to this difficulty.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item The overhead of spawning multiple threads per timestep dwarfs the work done by the update step
	\item The thread spawn behavior is sub-optimal as described by \cite{performance-critical}
	\item Thread affinity is poor.
	\item Threads may be competing for the global statistical variables we are using to measure performance.
\end{itemize}

We intend on investigating all of these possibilities immediately in the following weeks.  It is important to do so, because our argument for the applicability of this algorithm to parallel data-structures
is based on the necessity of competing with the highly-scalable naive algorithm.  If we fail to implement a scalable naive algorithm, then our ability to implement a scalable predictive algorithm is questionable.

\subsection{Completed Tasks}
\subsubsection{Simulation Framework}
We completed a simulation framework capable of interactively running our simulation in multiple different configurations from the command line.  Our simulation framework correctly
creates a simulation in a memory and cpu-efficiant way, and allows us to extend the implementation of the update step without changing the rest of the codebase.
\subsubsection{Visualization Framework}
In order to debug and to visualize the state of the simulation at a given timestep, a visualization in opengl was produced.
\subsubsection{Threaded and Non-Threaded Naive Implementation}
The implementation of our Naive algorithm is complete for the threaded and the non-threaded implementation.  However, as previously described, our implementation does not scale.  However, it is verified to function
correctly in both implementatons.

\subsection{Remaining Tasks}
There are 3 major tasks remaining 
Remaining tasks are to improve the scalability of the naive algo

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]

%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.


% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference
% number - used to balance the columns on the last page
% adjust value as needed - may need to be readjusted if
% the document is modified later
%\IEEEtriggeratref{8}
% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%\IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-5in}}
