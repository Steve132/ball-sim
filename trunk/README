 The following instructions should help you to build and install the source code contained in this archive, as well as give an overview of the content to be found:
 
 BUILDING:
Prerequisites:
	A version of G++ that with experimental support for the upcoming C++11 standard,as well as OpenMP
		-std::thread support
		-std::atomic support
		-OpenMP support
	
1)	Download and install CMake for your platform.
2)	run CMake.  Point the source directory to directory containing this README file.
	Point the binary directory to some directory (preferably ./build)
3)	Configure CMake in release mode (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release)
4)	Build the code using the IDE or make script you configured CMake with.
5)	In the binary directory there are two binaries: headless_sim and glviewer_sim. They accept the same command-line arguments.

To see a summary of the command line arguments, run one of the binaries with --help.  To see a visualization, run glviewer_sim.  
To enable the predictive algorithm, use the -p switch.  

You will find our document in /doc/final.pdf
You will find the source code in /src
You will find the data from our test scripts and the scripts to generate them in the root ball-sim directory (here)
