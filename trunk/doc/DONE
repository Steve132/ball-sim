COP 6616 Final Project
Nicholas Arnold
Steven Braeger

Completed Modules:
--------------------------
1) Object classes AxisPlane and Sphere
2) Overall project shell structure
3) Virtual class Simulation to hold default simulation values and functions
4) Derived class NaiveSimulation to implement the naive solution for checking every sphere, threaded and single-threaded.
5) NaiveSimulation::update and NaiveSimulation::update_threaded functions to calculate the updates to the spheres' positions as well as checking every sphere-sphere pair and sphere-wall pair for collision.
6) Sphere::collide function defined to calculate new velocity vectors of spheres after a collision is detected
