 

More Experiments to perform:
	-Comparing to Locking (or lock-free) Pqueue
	-Comparing to Locking Future Queue
	-Comparing to other nbody approach with bounding volumes

Organise a little better, one or more sections to identify comparison between naive algorithm and predictions better

Justify which nbody we compare against.  Justify when you may want to use our method.
	-BVH maybe bad because dynamic
